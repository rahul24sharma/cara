                <h4>The Cotton-Jersey Zip-Up Hoodie</h4>
                <p>Hooded sweatshirts are wardrobe staples that belong in every closet. Whether you are a guy or a girl, hoodies are fashion must-haves that are perfect for adding a bit of extra warmth to your outfit when it gets chilly. While they never really go out of style, they have been having a huge moment throughout the last few years as streetwear and athleisure looks have reigned supreme in the fashion world.

                    If you are in the market for new hoodies to add to your wardrobe, zip-up styles are always a solid investment. They bridge the gap between sweatshirts and jackets, and they are ideal for those days when it’s a bit too chilly to go out wearing just a t-shirt but too warm to wear a heavier coat.</p>

                <h4>How to style a Quiff</h4>
                <p>KOne of the most iconic haircuts to have ever graced men’s heads, the quiff has been big (and big news) since the 1950s, earning it a place in the follicular hall of fame alongside other icons of the barber’s chair including the French crop, buzz cut and short back and sides.

                    Splicing together elements of the pompadour, flat top and sometimes even the mohawk, unafraid to make its voluminous presence felt, the amped-up quiff suits a wide range of ages, face shapes and personal styles.
                    
                    According to research, it’s also judged one of the sexiest by women. When quizzed by styling product company Fudge on which men’s haircuts they are most likely to swipe right to on dating apps, 28 per cent of the 2,000 females asked picked the quiff.

                    1. Tommy Hilfiger – Pier 16
                    Tommy Hilfiger took over a working Manhatten pier for his runway showcase. The designer leaned into a boardwalk/carnival theme as a backdrop to his spring collection.
                    
                    2. Yeezy – Roosevelt Island
                    Just like his clothing line, Yeezy kept it simple. The rapper staged his runway event on an open lawn in the middle of Roosevelt Island. The only problem was, that he didn’t anticipate just how the heat would affect the models, some of which had to be escorted to the sidelines in the middle of the event.</p>
